# Employee-Tracker
Create an company tracking app using SQL, inquirer, and console.table.

The app dynamically updates an sql data base and presents information to its user allowing them to add employees, update roles, add departments, and view all departments, roles, and employees.

I ran out of time with this assignment and plan on revisting it when i have the time.
